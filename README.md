# Daily Tech Challenge #6
## Building a simple Jekyll blog

For today's challenge, I'm going to build the best Jekyll blog I can in a day.
I've never built a blog with Jekyll before, although I do have prior
understanding of how it works, and may have run Jekyll from the command line
once or twice. I never actually got serious about organizing my files around it,
however.

The focus for this challenge will be to build a blog that demonstrates a strong
understanding of Jekyll fundamentals.

For content, I'm going with Lorem Ipsum. I estimate the difficulty of this
challenge will be low, because it will mostly just involve familiarization with
Jekyll's command line tools and template syntax.
