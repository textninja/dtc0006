CHAPTER II: WHAT HAPPENS AND WHAT IS OBSERVED


A certain type of superior person is fond of asserting that “everything
is relative.” This is, of course, nonsense, because, if _everything_
were relative, there would be nothing for it to be relative to.
However, without falling into metaphysical absurdities it is possible
to maintain that everything in the physical world is relative to
an observer. This view, true or not, is _not_ that adopted by the
“theory of relativity.” Perhaps the name is unfortunate; certainly
it has led philosophers and uneducated people into confusions. They
imagine that the new theory proves _everything_ in the physical world
to be relative, whereas, on the contrary, it is wholly concerned to
exclude what is relative and arrive at a statement of physical laws
that shall in no way depend upon the circumstances of the observer. It
is true that these circumstances have been found to have more effect
upon what appears to the observer than they were formerly thought to
have, but at the same time Einstein showed how to discount this effect
completely. This was the source of almost everything that is surprising
in his theory.

When two observers perceive what is regarded as one occurrence, there
are certain similarities, and also certain differences, between their
perceptions. The differences are obscured by the requirements of
daily life, because from a business point of view they are as a rule
unimportant. But both psychology and physics, from their different
angles, are compelled to emphasize the respects in which one man’s
perception of a given occurrence differs from another man’s. Some of
these differences are due to differences in the brains or minds of
the observers, some to differences in their sense organs, some to
differences of physical situation: these three kinds may be called
respectively psychological, physiological, and physical. A remark made
in a language we know will be heard, whereas an equally loud remark
in an unknown language may pass entirely unnoticed. Of two men in the
Alps, one will perceive the beauty of the scenery while the other will
notice the waterfalls with a view to obtaining power from them. Such
differences are psychological. The difference between a long-sighted
and a short-sighted man, or between a deaf man and a man who hears
well, are physiological. Neither of these kinds concerns us, and I have
mentioned them only in order to exclude them. The kind that concerns us
is the purely physical kind. Physical differences between two observers
will be preserved when the observers are replaced by cameras or
phonographs, and can be reproduced on the movies or the gramophone. If
two men both listen to a third man speaking, and one of them is nearer
to the speaker than the other is, the nearer one will hear louder and
slightly earlier sounds than are heard by the other. If two men both
watch a tree falling, they see it from different angles. Both these
differences would be shown equally by recording instruments: they are
in no way due to idiosyncrasies in the observers, but are part of the
ordinary course of physical nature as we experience it.

The physicist, like the plain man, believes that his perceptions give
him knowledge about what is really occurring in the physical world,
and not only about his private experiences. Professionally, he regards
the physical world as “real,” not merely as something which human
beings dream. An eclipse of the sun, for instance, can be observed
by any person who is suitably situated, and is also observed by the
photographic plates that are exposed for the purpose. The physicist
is persuaded that something has really happened over and above the
experiences of those who have looked at the sun or at photographs of
it. I have emphasized this point, which might seem a trifle obvious,
because some people imagine that Einstein has made a difference in this
respect. In fact he has made none.

But if the physicist is justified in this belief that a number of
people can observe the “same” physical occurrence, then clearly the
physicist must be concerned with those features which the occurrence
has in common for all observers, for the others cannot be regarded
as belonging to the occurrence itself. At least, the physicist must
confine himself to the features which are common to all “equally
good” observers. The observer who uses a microscope or a telescope is
preferred to one who does not, because he sees all that the latter sees
and more too. A sensitive photographic plate may “see” still more,
and is then preferred to any eye. But such things as differences of
perspective, or differences of apparent size due to difference of
distance, are obviously not attributable to the object; they belong
solely to the point of view of the spectator. Common sense eliminates
these in judging of objects; physics has to carry the same process much
further, but the principle is the same.

I want to make it clear that I am not concerned with anything that can
be called inaccuracy. I am concerned with genuine physical differences
between occurrences each of which is a correct record of a certain
event, from its own point of view. When a man fires a gun, people who
are not quite close to him see the flash before they hear the report.
This is not due to any defect in their senses, but to the fact that
sound travels more slowly than light. Light travels so fast that, from
the point of view of phenomena on the surface of the earth, it may
be regarded as instantaneous. Anything that we can see on the earth
happens practically at the moment when we see it. In a second, light
travels 300,000 kilometers (about 186,000 miles). It travels from the
sun to the earth in about eight minutes, and from the stars to us in
anything from three to a thousand years. But of course we cannot place
a clock in the sun, and send out a flash of light from it at 12 noon,
Greenwich Mean Time, and have it received at Greenwich at 12.08 P.M.
Our methods of estimating the speed of light have to be more or less
indirect. The only direct method would be that which we apply to sound
when we use an echo. We could send a flash to a mirror, and observe how
long it took for the reflection to reach us; this would give the time
of the double journey to the mirror and back. On the earth, however,
the time would be so short that a great deal of theoretical physics
has to be utilized if this method is to be employed—more even than is
required for the employment of astronomical data.

The problem of allowing for the spectator’s point of view, we may be
told, is one of which physics has at all times been fully aware; indeed
it has dominated astronomy ever since the time of Copernicus. This is
true. But principles are often acknowledged long before their full
consequences are drawn. Much of traditional physics is incompatible
with the principle, in spite of the fact that it was acknowledged
theoretically by all physicists.

There existed a set of rules which caused uneasiness to the
philosophically minded, but were accepted by physicists because
they worked in practice. Locke had distinguished “secondary”
qualities—colors, noises, tastes, smells, etc.—as subjective, while
allowing “primary” qualities—shapes and positions and sizes—to be
genuine properties of physical objects. The physicist’s rules were
such as would follow from this doctrine. Colors and noises were
allowed to be subjective, but due to waves proceeding with a definite
velocity—that of light or sound as the case may be—from their source
to the eye or ear of the percipient. Apparent shapes vary according to
the laws of perspective, but these laws are simple and make it easy to
infer the “real” shapes from several visual apparent shapes; moreover,
the “real” shapes can be ascertained by touch in the case of bodies in
our neighborhood. The objective time of a physical occurrence can be
inferred from the time when we perceive it by allowing for the velocity
of transmission—of light or sound or nerve currents according to
circumstances. This was the view adopted by physicists in practice,
whatever qualms they may have had in unprofessional moments.

This view worked well enough until physicists became concerned with
much greater velocities than those that are common on the surface of
the earth. An express train travels about a mile in a minute; the
planets travel a few miles in a second. Comets, when they are near
the sun, travel much faster, and behave somewhat oddly; but they were
puzzling in various ways. Practically, the planets were the most
swiftly moving bodies to which dynamics could be adequately applied.
With radio-activity a new range of observations became possible.
Individual electrons can be observed, emanating from radium with a
velocity not far short of that of light. The behavior of bodies moving
with these enormous speeds is not what the old theories would lead
us to expect. For one thing, mass seems to increase with speed in a
perfectly definite manner. When an electron is moving very fast, a
bigger force is required to have a given effect upon it than when it
is moving slowly. Then reasons were found for thinking that the size
of a body is affected by its motion—for example, if you take a cube
and move it very fast, it gets shorter in the direction of its motion,
from the point of view of a person who is not moving with it, though
from its own point of view (_i.e._ for an observer traveling with it)
it remains just as it was. What was still more astonishing was the
discovery that lapse of time depends on motion; that is to say, two
perfectly accurate clocks, one of which is moving very fast relatively
to the other, will not continue to show the same time if they come
together again after a journey. It follows that what we discover by
means of clocks and foot rules, which used to be regarded as the acme
of impersonal science, is really in part dependent upon our private
circumstances, _i.e._ upon the way in which we are moving relatively to
the bodies measured.

This shows that we have to draw a different line from that which is
customary in distinguishing between what belongs to the observer and
what belongs to the occurrence which he is observing. If a man is
wearing blue spectacles he knows that the blue look of everything is
due to his spectacles, and does not belong to what he is observing.
But if he observes two flashes of lightning, and notes the interval
of time between his observations; if he knows where the flashes took
place, and allows, in each case, for the time the light took to reach
him—in that case, if his chronometer is accurate, he naturally thinks
that he has discovered the actual interval of time between the two
flashes, and not something merely personal to himself. He is confirmed
in this view by the fact that all other careful observers to whom he
has access agree with his estimates. This, however, is only due to the
fact that all these observers are on the earth, and share its motion.
Even two observers in aeroplanes moving in opposite directions would
have at the most a relative velocity of 400 miles an hour, which is
very little in comparison with 186,000 miles a second (the velocity
of light). If an electron shot out from a piece of radium with a
velocity of 170,000 miles a second could observe the time between the
two flashes, it would arrive at a quite different estimate, after
making full allowance for the velocity of light. How do you know this?
the reader may ask. You are not an electron, you cannot move at these
terrific speeds, no man of science has ever made the observations which
would prove the truth of your assertion. Nevertheless, as we shall see
in the sequel, there is good ground for the assertion—ground, first
of all, in experiment, and—what is remarkable—ground in reasonings
which could have been made at any time, but were not made until
experiments had shown that the old reasonings must be wrong.

There is a general principle to which the theory of relativity appeals,
which turns out to be more powerful than anybody would suppose. If
you know that one man is twice as rich as another, this fact must
appear equally whether you estimate the wealth of both in pounds or
dollars or francs or any other currency. The numbers representing their
fortunes will be changed, but one number will always be double the
other. The same sort of thing, in more complicated forms, reappears in
physics. Since all motion is relative, you may take any body you like
as your standard body of reference, and estimate all other motions
with reference to that one. If you are in a train and walking to the
dining-car, you naturally, for the moment, treat the train as fixed
and estimate your motion by relation to it. But when you think of the
journey you are making, you think of the earth as fixed, and say you
are moving at the rate of sixty miles an hour. An astronomer who is
concerned with the solar system takes the sun as fixed, and regards you
as rotating and revolving; in comparison with this motion, that of the
train is so slow that it hardly counts. An astronomer who is interested
in the stellar universe may add the motion of the sun relatively to
the average of the stars. You cannot say that one of these ways of
estimating your motion is more correct than another; each is perfectly
correct as soon as the reference body is assigned. Now just as you can
estimate a man’s fortune in different currencies without altering its
relations to the fortunes of other men, so you can estimate a body’s
motion by means of different reference bodies without altering its
relations to other motions. And as physics is entirely concerned with
relations, it must be possible to express all the laws of physics by
referring all motions to any given body as the standard.

We may put the matter in another way. Physics is intended to give
information about what really occurs in the physical world, and not
only about the private perceptions of separate observers. Physics must,
therefore, be concerned with those features which a physical process
has in common for all observers, since such features alone can be
regarded as belonging to the physical occurrence itself. This requires
that the _laws_ of phenomena should be the same whether the phenomena
are described as they appear to one observer or as they appear to
another. This single principle is the generating motive of the whole
theory of relativity.

Now what we have hitherto regarded as the spatial and temporal
properties of physical occurrences are found to be in large part
dependent upon the observer; only a residue can be attributed to the
occurrences in themselves, and only this residue can be involved in
the formulation of any physical law which is to have an _à priori_
chance of being true. Einstein found ready to his hand an instrument of
pure mathematics, called the theory of tensors, which enabled him to
discover laws expressed in terms of the objective residue and agreeing
approximately with the old laws. Where Einstein’s laws differed from
the old ones, they have hitherto proved more in accord with observation.

If there were no reality in the physical world, but only a number of
dreams dreamed by different people, we should not expect to find any
laws connecting the dreams of one man with the dreams of another. It
is the close connection between the perceptions of one man and the
(roughly) simultaneous perceptions of another that makes us believe in
a common external origin of the different related perceptions. Physics
accounts both for the likenesses and for the differences between
different people’s perceptions of what we call the “same” occurrence.
But in order to do this it is first necessary for the physicist to
find out just what are the likenesses. They are not quite those
traditionally assumed, because neither space nor time separately can
be taken as strictly objective. What is objective is a kind of mixture
of the two called “space-time.” To explain this is not easy, but the
attempt must be made; it will be begun in the next chapter.
