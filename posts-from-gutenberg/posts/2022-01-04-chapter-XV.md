CHAPTER XV: PHILOSOPHICAL CONSEQUENCES


The philosophical consequences of relativity are neither so great nor
so startling as is sometimes thought. It throws very little light on
time-honored controversies, such as that between realism and idealism.
Some people think that it supports Kant’s view that space and time are
“subjective” and are “forms of intuition.” I think such people have
been misled by the way in which writers on relativity speak of “the
observer.” It is natural to suppose that the observer is a human being,
or at least a mind; but he is just as likely to be a photographic
plate or a clock. That is to say, the odd results as to the difference
between one “point of view” and another are concerned with “point of
view” in a sense applicable to physical instruments just as much as to
people with perceptions. The “subjectivity” concerned in the theory of
relativity is a _physical_ subjectivity, which would exist equally if
there were no such things as minds or senses in the world.

Moreover, it is a strictly limited subjectivity. The theory does
not say that _everything_ is relative; on the contrary, it gives a
technique for distinguishing what is relative from what belongs to a
physical occurrence in its own right. If we are going to say that the
theory supports Kant about space and time, we shall have to say that it
refutes him about space-time. In my view, neither statement is correct.
I see no reason why, on such issues, philosophers should not all stick
to the views they previously held. There were no conclusive arguments
on either side before, and there are none now; to hold either view
shows a dogmatic rather than a scientific temper.

Nevertheless, when the ideas involved in Einstein’s work have become
familiar, as they will when they are taught in schools, certain changes
in our habits of thought are likely to result, and to have great
importance in the long run.

One thing which emerges is that physics tells us much less about
the physical world than we thought it did. Almost all the “great
principles” of traditional physics turn out to be like the “great
law” that there are always three feet to a yard; others turn out to
be downright false. The conservation of mass may serve to illustrate
both these misfortunes to which a “law” is liable. Mass used to be
defined as “quantity of matter,” and as far as experiment showed it
was never increased or diminished. But with the greater accuracy of
modern measurements, curious things were found to happen. In the first
place, the mass as measured was found to increase with the velocity;
this kind of mass was found to be really the same thing as energy. This
kind of mass is not constant for a given body, but the total amount of
it in the universe is conserved, or at least obeys a law very closely
analogous to conservation. This law itself, however, is to be regarded
as a truism, of the nature of the “law” that there are three feet to a
yard; it results from our methods of measurement, and does not express
a genuine property of matter. The other kind of mass, which we may call
“proper mass,” is that which is found to be the mass by an observer
moving with the body. This is the ordinary terrestrial case, where
the body we are weighing is not flying through the air. The “proper
mass” of a body is very nearly constant, but not quite, and the total
amount of “proper mass” in the world is not quite constant. One would
suppose that if you have four one-pound weights, and you put them all
together into the scales, they will together weigh four pounds. This is
a fond delusion: they weigh rather less, though not enough less to be
discovered by even the most careful measurements. In the case of four
hydrogen atoms, however, when they are put together to make one helium
atom, the defect is noticeable; the helium atom weighs measurably less
than four separate hydrogen atoms.

Broadly speaking, traditional physics has collapsed into two portions,
truisms and geography. There are, however, newer portions of physics,
such as the theory of quanta, which do not come under this head, but
appear to give genuine knowledge of laws reached by experiment.

The world which the theory of relativity presents to our imagination
is not so much a world of “things” in “motion” as a world of _events_.
It is true that there are still electrons and protons which persist,
but these (as we saw in the preceding chapter) are really to be
conceived as strings of connected events, like the successive notes
of a song. It is _events_ that are the stuff of relativity physics.
Between two events which are not too remote from each other there is,
in the general theory as in the special theory, a measurable relation
called “interval,” which appears to be the physical reality of which
lapse of time and distance in space are two more or less confused
representations. Between two distant events, there is not any one
definite interval. But there is one way of moving from one event to
another which makes the sum of all the little intervals along the route
greater than by any other route. This route is called a “geodesic,” and
it is the route which a body will choose if left to itself.

The whole of relativity physics is a much more step-by-step matter than
the physics and geometry of former days. Euclid’s straight lines have
to be replaced by light rays, which do not quite come up to Euclid’s
standard of straightness when they pass near the sun or any other very
heavy body. The sum of the angles of a triangle is still thought to be
two right angles in very remote regions of empty space, but not where
there is matter in the neighborhood. We, who cannot leave the earth,
are incapable of reaching a place where Euclid is true. Propositions
which used to be proved by reasoning have now become either
conventions, or merely approximate truths verified by observation.

It is a curious fact—of which relativity is not the only
illustration—that, as reasoning improves, its claims to the power of
proving facts grow less and less. Logic used to be thought to teach
us how to draw inferences; now, it teaches us rather how not to draw
inferences. Animals and children are terribly prone to inference: a
horse is surprised beyond measure if you take an unusual turning. When
men began to reason, they tried to justify the inferences that they
had drawn unthinkingly in earlier days. A great deal of bad philosophy
and bad science resulted from this propensity. “Great principles,”
such as the “uniformity of nature,” the “law of universal causation,”
and so on, are attempts to bolster up our belief that what has often
happened before will happen again, which is no better founded than the
horse’s belief that you will take the turning you usually take. It is
not altogether easy to see what is to replace these pseudo-principles
in the practice of science; but perhaps the theory of relativity gives
us a glimpse of the kind of thing we may expect. Causation, in the
old sense, no longer has a place in theoretical physics. There is,
of course, something else which takes its place, but the substitute
appears to have a better empirical foundation than the old principle
which it has superseded.

The collapse of the notion of one all-embracing time, in which all
events throughout the universe can be dated, must in the long run
affect our views as to cause and effect, evolution, and many other
matters. For instance, the question whether, on the whole, there is
progress in the universe, may depend upon our choice of a measure of
time. If we choose one out of a number of equally good clocks, we may
find that the universe is progressing as fast as the most optimistic
American thinks it is; if we choose another equally good clock, we may
find that the universe is going from bad to worse as fast as the most
melancholy Slav could imagine. Thus optimism and pessimism are neither
true nor false, but depend upon the choice of clocks.

The effect of this upon a certain type of emotion is devastating. The
poet speaks of

    One far-off divine event
    To which the whole creation moves.

But if the event is sufficiently far off, and the creation moves
sufficiently quickly, some parts will judge that the event has already
happened, while others will judge that it is still in the future. This
spoils the poetry. The second line ought to be:

    To which some parts of the creation move,
       while others move away from it.

But this won’t do. I suggest that an emotion which can be destroyed by
a little mathematics is neither very genuine nor very valuable. But
this line of argument would lead to a criticism of the Victorian Age,
which lies outside my theme.

What we know about the physical world, I repeat, is much more
abstract, than was formerly supposed. Between bodies there are
occurrences, such as light waves; of the _laws_ of these occurrences,
we know something—just so much as can be expressed in mathematical
formulæ—but of their _nature_ we know nothing. Of the bodies
themselves, as we saw in the preceding chapter, we know so little
that we cannot even be sure that they are anything: they _may_ be
merely groups of events in other places, those events which we should
naturally regard as their effects. We naturally interpret the world
pictorially; that is to say, we imagine that what goes on is more or
less like what we see. But in fact this likeness can only extend to
certain formal logical properties expressing structure, so that all we
can know is certain general characteristics of its changes. Perhaps an
illustration may make the matter clear. Between a piece of orchestral
music as played, and the same piece of music as printed in the score,
there is a certain resemblance, which may be described as a resemblance
in structure. The resemblance is of such a sort that, when you know the
rules, you can infer the music from the score or the score from the
music. But suppose you had been stone deaf from birth, but had lived
among musical people. You could understand, if you had learned to speak
and to do lip-reading, that the musical scores represented something
quite different from themselves in intrinsic quality, though similar in
structure.[16] The value of music would be completely unimaginable to
you, but you could infer all its mathematical characteristics, since
they are the same as those of the score. Now our knowledge of nature is
something like this. We can read the scores, and infer just so much as
our stone-deaf person could have inferred about music. But we have not
the advantages which he derived from association with musical people.
We cannot know whether the music represented by the scores is beautiful
or hideous; perhaps, in the last analysis, we cannot be quite sure that
the scores represent anything but themselves. But this is a doubt which
the physicist, in his professional capacity, cannot permit himself to
entertain.

[16] For the definition of “structure,” see the present author’s
_Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy_.

Assuming the utmost that can be claimed for physics, it does not tell
us what it is that changes, or what are its various states; it only
tells us such things as that changes follow each other periodically,
or spread with a certain speed. Even now we are probably not at the
end of the process of stripping away what is merely imagination, in
order to reach the core of true scientific knowledge. The theory of
relativity has accomplished a very great deal in this respect, and in
doing so has taken us nearer and nearer to bare structure, which is
the mathematician’s goal—not because it is the only thing in which he
is interested as a human being, but because it is the only thing that
he can express in mathematical formulæ. But far as we have traveled in
the direction of abstraction, it may be that we shall have to travel
further still.

In the preceding chapter, I suggested what may be called a minimum
definition of matter, that is to say, one in which matter has, so
to speak, as little “substance” as is compatible with the truth of
physics. In adopting a definition of this kind, we are playing for
safety: our tenuous matter will exist, even if something more beefy
also exists. We tried to make our definition of matter, like Isabella’s
gruel in Jane Austen, “thin, but not too thin.” We shall, however, fall
into error if we assert positively that matter is nothing more than
this. Leibniz thought that a piece of matter is really a colony of
souls. There is nothing to show that he was wrong, though there is also
nothing to show that he was right: we know no more about it either way
than we do about the flora and fauna of Mars.

To the non-mathematical mind, the abstract character of our physical
knowledge may seem unsatisfactory. From an artistic or imaginative
point of view, it is perhaps regrettable, but from a practical point
of view it is of no consequence. Abstraction, difficult as it is, is
the source of practical power. A financier, whose dealings with the
world are more abstract than those of any other “practical” man, is
also more powerful than any other practical man. He can deal in wheat
or cotton without needing ever to have seen either: all he needs to
know is whether they will go up or down. This is abstract mathematical
knowledge, at least as compared to the knowledge of the agriculturist.
Similarly the physicist, who knows nothing of matter except certain
laws of its movements, nevertheless knows enough to enable him to
manipulate it. After working through whole strings of equations, in
which the symbols stand for things whose intrinsic nature can never be
known to us, he arrives at last at a result which can be interpreted
in terms of our own perceptions, and utilized to bring about desired
effects in our own lives. What we know about matter, abstract and
schematic as it is, is enough, in principle, to tell us the rules
according to which it produces perceptions and feelings in ourselves;
and it is upon these rules that the _practical_ uses of physics depend.

The final conclusion is that we know very little, and yet it is
astonishing that we know so much, and still more astonishing that so
little knowledge can give us so much power.
