CHAPTER XIV: WHAT IS MATTER?


The question “What is matter?” is of the kind that is asked by
metaphysicians, and answered in vast books of incredible obscurity.
But I am not asking the question as metaphysician: I am asking it as a
person who wants to find out what is the moral of modern physics, and
more especially of the theory of relativity. It is obvious from what we
have learned of that theory that matter cannot be conceived quite as it
used to be. I think we can now say more or less what the new conception
must be.

There were two traditional conceptions of matter, both of which have
had advocates ever since scientific speculation began. There were
the atomists, who thought that matter consisted of tiny lumps which
could never be divided; these were supposed to hit each other and then
bounce off in various ways. After Newton, they were no longer supposed
actually to come into contact with each other, but to attract and
repel each other, and move in orbits round each other. Then there
were those who thought that there is matter of some kind everywhere,
and that a true vacuum is impossible. Descartes held this view, and
attributed the motions of the planets to vortices in the ether. The
Newtonian theory of gravitation caused the view that there is matter
everywhere to fall into discredit, the more so as light was thought by
Newton and his disciples to be due to actual particles traveling from
the source of the light. But when this view of light was disproved, and
it was shown that light consisted of waves, the ether was revived so
that there should be something to undulate. The ether became still more
respectable when it was found to play the same part in electromagnetic
phenomena as in the propagation of light. It was even hoped that atoms
might turn out to be a mode of motion of the ether. At this stage, the
atomic view of matter was, on the whole, getting the worst of it.

Leaving relativity aside for the moment, modern physics has provided
proof of the atomic structure of ordinary matter, while not disproving
the arguments in favor of the ether, to which no such structure is
attributed. The result was a sort of compromise between the two views,
the one applying to what was called “gross” matter, the other to the
ether. There can be no doubt about electrons and protons, though, as we
shall see shortly, they need not be conceived as atoms were conceived
traditionally. As for the ether, its status is very curious: many
physicists still maintain that, without it, the propagation of light
and other electromagnetic waves would be inconceivable, but except in
this way it is difficult to see what purpose it serves. The truth is,
I think, that relativity demands the abandonment of the old conception
of “matter,” which is infected by the metaphysics associated with
“substance,” and represents a point of view not really necessary in
dealing with phenomena. This is what we must now investigate.

In the old view, a piece of matter was something which survived all
through time, while never being at more than one place at a given time.
This way of looking at things is obviously connected with the complete
separation of space and time in which people formerly believed. When we
substitute space-time for space and time, we shall naturally expect to
derive the physical world from constituents which are as limited in
time as in space. Such constituents are what we call “events.” An event
does not persist and move, like the traditional piece of matter; it
merely exists for its little moment and then ceases. A piece of matter
will thus be resolved into a series of events. Just as, in the old
view, an extended body was composed of a number of particles, so, now,
each particle, being extended in time, must be regarded as composed
of what we may call “event-particles.” The whole series of these
events makes up the whole history of the particle, and the particle is
regarded as _being_ its history, not some metaphysical entity to which
the events happen. This view is rendered necessary by the fact that
relativity compels us to place time and space more on a level than they
were in the older physics.

This abstract requirement must be brought into relation with the known
facts of the physical world. Now what are the known facts? Let us
take it as conceded that light consists of waves traveling with the
received velocity. We then know a great deal about what goes on in
the parts of space-time where there is no matter; we know, that is to
say, that there are periodic occurrences (light waves) obeying certain
laws. These light waves start from atoms, and the modern theory of
the structure of the atoms enables us to know a great deal about the
circumstances under which they start, and the reasons which determine
their wave lengths. We can find out not only how one light wave
travels, but how its source moves relatively to ourselves. But when I
say this I am assuming that we can recognise a source of light as the
same at two slightly different times. This is, however, the very thing
which had to be investigated.

We saw, in the preceding chapter, how a group of connected events can
be formed, all related to each other by a law, and all ranged about a
center in space-time. Such a group of events will be the arrival, at
various places, of the light waves emitted by a brief flash of light.
We do not need to suppose that anything particular is happening at the
center; certainly we do not need to suppose that we know _what_ is
happening there. What we know is that, as a matter of geometry, the
group of events in question are ranged about a center, like widening
ripples on a pool when a fly has touched it. We can hypothetically
invent an occurrence which is to have happened at the center, and set
forth the laws by which the consequent disturbance is transmitted. This
hypothetical occurrence will then appear to common sense as the “cause”
of the disturbance. It will also count as one event in the biography of
the particle of matter which is supposed to occupy the center of the
disturbance.

Now we find not only that one light wave travels outward from a center
according to a certain law, but also that, in general, it is followed
by other closely similar light waves. The sun, for example, does not
change its appearance suddenly; even if a cloud passes across it during
a high wind, the transition is gradual, though swift. In this way a
group of occurrences connected with a center at one point of space-time
is brought into relation with other very similar groups whose centers
are at neighboring points of space-time. For each of these other groups
common sense invents similar hypothetical occurrences to occupy their
centers, and says that all these hypothetical occurrences are part of
one history; that is to say, it invents a hypothetical “particle” to
which the hypothetical occurrences are to have occurred. It is only by
this double use of hypothesis, perfectly unnecessary in each case, that
we arrive at anything that can be called “matter” in the old sense of
the word.

If we are to avoid unnecessary hypotheses, we shall say that an
electron at a given moment is the various disturbances in the
surrounding medium which, in ordinary language, would be said to be
“caused” by it. But we shall not take these disturbances at what is,
for us, the moment in question, since that would make them depend upon
the observer; we shall instead travel outward from the electron with
the velocity of light, and take the disturbance we find in each place
as we reach it. The closely similar set of disturbances, with very
nearly the same center, which is found existing slightly earlier or
slightly later, will be defined as _being_ the electron at a slightly
earlier or slightly later moment. In this way, we preserve all the
laws of physics, without having recourse to unnecessary hypotheses or
inferred entities, and we remain in harmony with the general principle
of economy which has enabled the theory of relativity to clear away so
much useless lumber.

Common sense imagines that when it sees a table it sees a table. This
is a gross delusion. When common sense sees a table, certain light
waves reach its eyes, and these are of a sort which, in its previous
experience, has been associated with certain sensations of touch, as
well as with other people’s testimony that they also saw the table.
But none of this ever brought us to the table itself. The light waves
caused occurrences in our eyes, and these caused occurrences in the
optic nerve, and these in turn caused occurrences in the brain. Any one
of these, happening without the usual preliminaries, would have caused
us to have the sensations we call “seeing the table,” even if there had
been no table. (Of course, if matter in general is to be interpreted
as a group of occurrences, this must apply also to the eye, the optic
nerve, and the brain.) As to the sense of touch when we press the table
with our fingers, that is an electric disturbance in the electrons and
protons of our finger tips, produced, according to modern physics, by
the proximity of the electrons and protons in the table. If the same
disturbance in our finger tips arose in any other way, we should have
the same sensations, in spite of there being no table. The testimony
of others is obviously a second-hand affair. A witness in a law court,
if asked whether he had seen some occurrence, would not be allowed to
reply that he believed so because of the testimony of others to that
effect. In any case, testimony consists of sound waves and demands
psychological as well as physical interpretation; its connection with
the object is therefore very indirect. For all these reasons, when
we say that a man “sees a table,” we use a highly abbreviated form
of expression, concealing complicated and difficult inferences, the
validity of which may well be open to question.

But we are in danger of becoming entangled in psychological questions,
which we must avoid if we can. Let us therefore return to the purely
physical point of view.

What I wish to suggest may be put as follows. Everything that occurs
elsewhere, owing to the existence of an electron, can be explored
experimentally, at least in theory, unless it occurs in certain
concealed ways. But what occurs within the electron (if anything occurs
there) it is absolutely impossible to know: there is no conceivable
apparatus by which we could obtain even a glimpse of it. An electron is
known by its “effects.” But the word “effects” belongs to a view of
causation which will not fit modern physics, and in particular will
not fit relativity. All that we have a right to say is that certain
groups of occurrences happen together, that is to say, in neighboring
parts of space-time. A given observer will regard one member of the
group as earlier than the other, but another observer may judge the
time order differently. And even when the time order is the same for
all observers, all that we really have is a connection between the two
events, which works equally backwards and forwards. It is not true that
the past determines the future in some sense other than that in which
the future determines the past: the apparent difference is only due to
our ignorance, because we know less about the future than about the
past. This is a mere accident: there might be beings who would remember
the future and have to infer the past. The feelings of such beings
in these matters would be the exact opposite of our own, but no more
fallacious.

The moral of this is that, if an electron is only known by its
“effects,” there is no reason to suppose that anything exists except
the “effects.” In so far as these “effects” consist of light waves
and other electromagnetic disturbances, we may say that what is
called “empty space” consists of regions where these disturbances are
propagated freely. Every such disturbance, we find, has a center, and
when we get very near the center (though still at a finite distance
from it) we find that the law of propagation of the disturbance ceases
to be valid. This region within which the law does not hold is called
“matter”; it will be an electron or proton according to circumstances.
The region so defined is found to move relatively to other such
regions, and its movements follow the known laws of dynamics. So far,
this theory provides for electromagnetic phenomena and the motions of
matter; and it does so without assuming that “matter” is anything but
systems of electromagnetic phenomena. In order to carry out the theory
fully, it would no doubt be necessary to introduce many complications.
But it seems fairly clear that all the facts and laws of physics
can be interpreted without assuming that “matter” is anything more
than groups of events, each event being of the sort which we should
naturally regard as “caused” by the matter in question. This does not
involve any change in the symbols or formulæ of physics: it is merely
a question of interpretation of the symbols.

This latitude in interpretation is a characteristic of mathematical
physics. What we know is certain very abstract logical relations,
which we express in mathematical formulæ; we know also that, at
certain points, we arrive at results which are capable of being tested
experimentally. Take, for example, the eclipse observations by which
Einstein’s theory as to the bending of light was established. The
actual observation consisted in the careful measurement of certain
distances on certain photographic plates. The formulæ which were to
be verified were concerned with the course of light in passing near
the sun. Although the part of these formulæ which gives the observed
result must always be interpreted in the same way, the other part of
them may be capable of a great variety of interpretations. The formulæ
giving the motions of the planets are almost exactly the same in
Einstein’s theory as in Newton’s, but the meaning of the formulæ is
quite different. It may be said generally that, in the mathematical
treatment of nature, we can be far more certain that our formulæ are
approximately correct than we can be as to the correctness of this or
that interpretation of them. And so in the case with which this chapter
is concerned: the question as to the nature of an electron or a proton
is by no means answered when we know all that mathematical physics has
to say as to the laws of its motion and the laws of its interaction
with the environment. A definite and conclusive answer to our question
is not possible just because a variety of answers are compatible with
the truth of mathematical physics. Nevertheless some answers are
preferable to others, because some have a greater probability in their
favor. We have been seeking, in this chapter, to define matter so that
there _must_ be such a thing if the formulæ of physics are true. If we
had made our definition such as to secure that a particle of matter
should be what one thinks of as substantial, a hard, definite lump, we
should not have been _sure_ that any such thing exists. That is why
our definition, though it may seem complicated, is preferable from the
point of view of logical economy and scientific caution.
