CHAPTER XI: IS THE UNIVERSE FINITE?


We have been dealing hitherto with matters that must be regarded as
acquired scientific results—not that they will never be found to need
improvement, but that further progress must be built upon them, as
Einstein is built upon Newton. Science does not aim at establishing
immutable truths and eternal dogmas: its aim is to approach truth by
successive approximations, without claiming that at any stage final and
complete accuracy has been achieved. There is a difference, however,
between results which are pretty certainly in the line of advance, and
speculations which may or may not prove to be well founded. Some very
interesting speculations are connected with the theory of relativity,
and we shall consider certain of them. But it must not be supposed that
we are dealing with theories having the same solidity as those with
which we have been concerned hitherto.

One of the most fascinating of the speculations to which I have been
alluding is the suggestion that the universe may be of finite extent.
Two somewhat different finite universes have been constructed, one by
Einstein, the other by De Sitter. Before considering their differences,
we will discuss what they have in common.

There are, to begin with, certain reasons for thinking that the total
amount of matter in the universe is limited. If this were not the
case, the gravitational effects of enormously distant matter would
make the kind of world in which we live impossible. We must therefore
suppose that there is some definite number of electrons and protons in
the world: theoretically, a complete census would be possible. These
are all contained within a certain finite region; whatever space lies
outside that region is, so to speak, waste, like unfurnished rooms in a
house too large for its inhabitants. This seems futile, but in former
days no one knew of any alternative possibility. It was obviously
impossible to conceive of an edge to space, and therefore, it was
thought, space must be infinite.

Non-Euclidean geometry, however, showed other possibilities. The
surface of a sphere has no boundary, yet it is not infinite. In
traveling round the earth, we never reach “the edge of the world,” and
yet the earth is not infinite. The surface of the earth is contained
in three-dimensional space, but there is no reason in logic why
three-dimensional space should not be constructed on an analogous plan.
What we imagine to be straight lines going on for ever will then be
like great circles on a sphere: they will ultimately return to their
starting point. There will not be in the universe anything straighter
than these great circles; the Euclidean straight line may remain as
a beautiful dream, but not as a possibility in the actual world. In
particular, light rays in empty space will travel in what are really
great circles. If we could make measurements with sufficient accuracy,
we should be able to infer this state of affairs even from a small part
of space, because the sum of the angles of a triangle would always be
greater than two right angles, and the excess would be proportional to
the size of the triangle. The suggestion we have to consider is the
suggestion that our universe may be spherical in this sense.

The reader must not confuse this suggestion with the non-Euclidean
character of space upon which the new law of gravitation depends. The
latter is concerned with small regions such as the solar system. The
departures from flatness which it notices are like hills and valleys
on the surface of the earth, local irregularities, not characteristics
of the whole. We are now concerned with the possible curvature of the
universe as a whole, not with the occasional ups and downs due to the
sun and the stars. It is suggested that on the average, and in regions
remote from matter, the universe is not quite flat, but has a slight
curvature, analogous, in three dimensions, to the curvature of a sphere
in two dimensions.

It is important to realize, in the first place, that there is not the
slightest reason _à priori_ why this should not be the case. People
unaccustomed to non-Euclidean geometry may feel that, even if such a
thing be _logically_ possible, the world simply _cannot_ be so odd
as all that. We all have a tendency to think that the world must
conform to our prejudices. The opposite view involves some effort of
thought, and most people would die sooner than think—in fact, they
do so. But the fact that a spherical universe seems odd to people
who have been brought up on Euclidean prejudices is no evidence that
it is impossible. There is no law of nature to the effect that what
is taught at school must be true. We cannot therefore dismiss the
hypothesis of a spherical universe as in any degree less worthy of
examination than any other. We have to ask ourselves the same two
questions as we should in any other case, namely: (1) Are the facts
consistent with this hypothesis? (2) Is this hypothesis the only one
with which the facts are consistent?

With regard to the first question, the answer is undoubtedly in the
affirmative. All the known facts are perfectly consistent with the
hypothesis of a spherical universe. A very slight modification of the
law of gravitation—a modification suggested by Einstein himself—leads
to a spherical space, without producing any measurable differences in a
small region such as the solar system. The known stars are all within
a certain distance from us. There is nothing whatever in the stellar
universe as we know it to show that space must be infinite. There can
therefore be no doubt whatever that, so far as our present knowledge
goes, the hypothesis of a finite universe _may_ be true.

But when we ask whether the hypothesis of a finite universe _must_
be true, the answer is different. It is obvious, on general grounds,
that we cannot, from what we know, draw conclusive inferences as to
the totality of things. A very slight change in the Newtonian formula
for gravitation would prevent masses beyond the limits of the visible
universe from having appreciable effects if they existed, and would
therefore destroy our reason for supposing that they do not exist.
All arguments as to regions which are too distant to be observed
depend upon extending to them the laws which hold in our part of
the world, and upon assuming that there is not, in these laws, some
inaccuracy which is inappreciable for observable distances, but fatal
to inferences in which very much greater distances are involved. We
cannot, therefore, say that the universe _must_ be finite. We can say
that it may be, and we can even say a little more than this. We can say
that a finite universe fits in better with the laws that hold in the
part we know, and that awkward adjustments of the laws have to be made
in order to allow the universe to be infinite. From the point of view
of choosing the best framework into which to fit what we know—best, I
mean, from a logico-æsthetic point of view—there is no doubt that the
hypothesis of a finite universe is preferable. This, I think, is the
extent of what can be said in its favor.

Let us now see what the two finite universes are like. The difference
between them is that in Einstein’s world it is only space that
is queer, whereas in De Sitter’s time is queer too. Consequently
Einstein’s world is less puzzling, and we will describe it first.

In Einstein’s world, light travels round the whole universe in a time
which is supposed to be something like a thousand million years. The
odd thing is that all the rays of light which start (say) from the sun
will meet again, after their enormous journey, in the place where the
sun was when they started. The case is exactly analogous to that of a
number of travelers who set out from London to go round the world in
great circles, all traveling at the same rate in different aeroplanes.
One starts due north, passes the North Pole, then the South Pole, and
finally comes home. Another starts due south, reaches the South Pole
first and then the North Pole. Another starts westward, but he must not
continue to travel due west, because then he would not be traveling on
a great circle. Another starts eastward, and so on. They all meet in
the antipodes of London, and then they all meet again in London. Now
if instead of aeronauts going round the earth you take rays of light
going round the universe, the same sort of thing happens: they all meet
first at the antipodes of their starting point, and then meet again at
their starting point. That means to say that a person who is near the
antipodes of the place where the sun was about five hundred million
years ago will see what is apparently a body as bright as the sun then
was (except for the small amount of light that has been stopped on the
way by opaque bodies), and having the same shape and size. And a person
who is near where the sun was a thousand million years ago will see
what is apparently a body just like what the sun was a thousand million
years ago. And the same applies to the antipodes of the sun fifteen
hundred million years ago, and to the place of the sun two thousand
million years ago, and so on. This series only ends when it carries us
back to a time before the sun existed.

But all these suns are only ghosts; that is to say, you could pass
through them without experiencing resistance, and they do not exert
gravitation. They are, in fact, like images in a mirror: they exist
only for the sense of sight, not for any other sense. It is rather
disturbing to reflect that, if this theory is true, any number of the
objects we see in the heavens may be merely ghosts. They are like
ghosts in their habit of revisiting the scenes of their past life.
Suppose a star had exploded at a certain place, as stars sometimes
will. Every thousand million years its ghost would return to the scene
of the disaster and explode again in the same place. There is, however,
considerable doubt whether rays of light could perform the journey with
sufficient accuracy to produce a clear image. Some would be stopped by
matter on the way, some would be turned out of the straight course by
passing near heavy bodies, as in the eclipse observations described in
Chapter IX, and for one reason or another their return would not be
punctual and exact.

There are various reasons for doubting whether Einstein’s universe can
be quite right.[12] Some of these are rather complicated. But there
is one objection which is easily appreciated: in Einstein’s theory,
absolute space and time re-enter by another door. The ghostly sun
is formed in the “place” where it was a thousand million years ago.
Both the “place” and the period of time are in a sense absolute. We
saw as early as Chapter I that “place” is a vague and popular notion,
incapable of scientific precision. It seems hardly worth while to go
through such a vast intellectual labor if the errors we set out to
correct are to reappear at the end.

[12] See Eddington, _Space, Time and Gravitation_, p. 162ff.

De Sitter’s world is even odder than Einstein’s, because time goes
mad as well as space. I despair of explaining, in non-mathematical
language, the particular form of lunacy with which time is afflicted,
but some of its manifestations can be described. An observer in this
world, if he observes a number of clocks, each of which is perfectly
accurate from its own point of view, will think that distant clocks
are going slow as compared with those in his neighborhood. They will
seem to go slower and slower, until, at a distance of one quarter of
the circumference of the universe, they will seem to have stopped
altogether. That region will seem to our observer a sort of lotus
land, where nothing is ever done. He will not be able to have any
cognizance of things farther off, because no light waves can get across
the boundary. Not that there is any real boundary: the people who live
in what our observer takes to be lotus land live just as bustling a
life as he does, but get the impression that he is eternally standing
still. As a matter of fact, you would never become aware of the lotus
land, because it would take an infinite time for light to travel from
it to you. You could become aware of places just short of it, but it
would remain itself always just beyond your ken. There will not be the
ghostly suns of Einstein’s world, because light cannot travel so far.

One of the oddest things about this state of affairs is that empirical
evidence for or against it is possible, and that there is actually
some slight evidence in its favor. If all “clocks” are slowed down at
a great distance from the observer, this will apply to the periodic
motions of atoms, and therefore to the light which they emit.
Consequently all rays of light emitted by distant objects ought, when
they reach us, to look rather more red or less violet than when they
started. This can be tested by the spectroscope. We can compare a
known line, as it appears in the spectrum of a spiral nebula, with
the same line as it appears in a terrestrial laboratory. We find, as a
matter of fact, that in a large majority of spiral nebulæ there is a
considerable displacement of spectral lines towards the red. The spiral
nebulæ are the most distant objects we can see: Eddington states that
their distances “may perhaps be of the order of a million light-years.”
(A light-year is the distance light travels in a year.) The usual
interpretation of a shifting of spectral lines towards the red is that
it is a “Doppler effect,” due to the fact that the source of light is
moving away from us. But one would expect to find the nebulæ just as
often moving towards us as moving away from us, if nothing operated but
the law of chances. If the world is such as De Sitter says it is, the
spectral lines of the spiral nebulæ will be displaced towards the red
owing to the slowing down of distant clocks, even if in fact they are
not moving away from us. This, for what it is worth, is an argument in
favor of De Sitter.

The same facts afford another argument in favor of De Sitter, for
another reason. If, at a given moment, a body is at rest relatively to
the observer, and at a distance from him, it will (in the absence of
counteracting causes) not remain at rest from his point of view, but
will begin to move away from him, and will continue to move away faster
and faster; the further it is from him, the more its retreat will be
accelerated. For bodies which are not too distant from each other,
gravitation may overcome this tendency; but as this tendency increases
with the distance, while gravitation diminishes, we should expect
to find very distant bodies receding from us if De Sitter’s theory
is right. Thus we have two reasons for the displacement of spectral
lines in spiral nebulæ: one, the slowing down of time; the other, the
movement away from us which we should expect at distances too great
for gravitation to be sensible. However, it cannot be said that the
argument, on either ground, is very strong. Eddington gives a list
of forty-one spiral nebulæ, of which five have their spectral lines
shifted towards the violet, not towards the red. Thus the material is
neither very copious nor quite harmonious.

Einstein’s and De Sitter’s hypotheses do not exhaust the possibilities
of a finite world: they are merely the two simplest forms of such a
world. There are arguments against each, and it hardly seems probable
that either is quite true. But it does seem probable that something
more or less analogous is true. If the universe is finite, it is
theoretically conceivable that there should be a complete inventory
of it. We may be coming to the end of what physics can do in the way
of stretching the imagination and systematizing the world. The period
since Galileo has been essentially the period of physics, as the age of
the Greeks was the period of geometry. It may be that physics will lose
its attractions through success: if the fundamental laws of physics
come to be fully known, adventurous and inquiring intellects will turn
to other fields. This may alter profoundly the whole texture of human
life, since our present absorption in machinery and industrialism is
the reflection in the practical world of the theorist’s interest in
physical laws. But such speculations are even more rash than those of
De Sitter, and I do not wish to lay any stress upon them.
