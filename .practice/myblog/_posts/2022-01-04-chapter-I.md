CHAPTER ONE: TOUCH AND SIGHT: THE EARTH AND THE HEAVENS


Everybody knows that Einstein has done something astonishing, but
very few people know exactly what it is that he has done. It is
generally recognized that he has revolutionized our conception of the
physical world, but his new conceptions are wrapped up in mathematical
technicalities. It is true that there are innumerable popular
accounts of the theory of relativity, but they generally cease to
be intelligible just at the point where they begin to say something
important. The authors are hardly to blame for this. Many of the new
ideas can be expressed in non-mathematical language, but they are none
the less difficult on that account. What is demanded is a change in
our imaginative picture of the world—a picture which has been handed
down from remote, perhaps pre-human, ancestors, and has been learned
by each one of us in early childhood. A change in our imagination is
always difficult, especially when we are no longer young. The same sort
of change was demanded by Copernicus, when he taught that the earth
is not stationary and the heavens do not revolve about it once a day.
To us now there is no difficulty in this idea, because we learned it
before our mental habits had become fixed. Einstein’s ideas, similarly,
will seem easy to a generation which has grown up with them; but for
our generation a certain effort of imaginative reconstruction is
unavoidable.

In exploring the surface of the earth, we make use of all our senses,
more particularly of the senses of touch and sight. In measuring
lengths, parts of the human body are employed in pre-scientific
ages: a “foot,” a “cubit,” a “span” are defined in this way. For
longer distances, we think of the time it takes to walk from one
place to another. We gradually learn to judge distances roughly by
the eye, but we rely upon touch for accuracy. Moreover it is touch
that gives us our sense of “reality.” Some things cannot be touched:
rainbows, reflections in looking-glasses, and so on. These things
puzzle children, whose metaphysical speculations are arrested by the
information that what is in the looking glass is not “real.” Macbeth’s
dagger was unreal because it was not “sensible to feeling as to sight.”
Not only our geometry and physics, but our whole conception of what
exists outside us, is based upon the sense of touch. We carry this even
into our metaphors: a good speech is “solid,“ a bad speech is “gas,”
because we feel that a gas is not quite “real.”

In studying the heavens, we are debarred from all senses except sight.
We cannot touch the sun, or travel to it; we cannot walk round the
moon, or apply a foot rule to the Pleiades. Nevertheless, astronomers
have unhesitatingly applied the geometry and physics which they found
serviceable on the surface of the earth, and which they had based
upon touch and travel. In doing so, they brought down trouble on
their heads, which it has been left for Einstein to clear up. It has
turned out that much of what we learned from the sense of touch was
unscientific prejudice, which must be rejected if we are to have a true
picture of the world.

An illustration may help us to understand how much is impossible to
the astronomer as compared to the man who is interested in things on
the surface of the earth. Let us suppose that a drug is administered
to you which makes you temporarily unconscious, and that when you
wake you have lost your memory but not your reasoning powers. Let us
suppose further that while you were unconscious you were carried into
a balloon, which, when you come to, is sailing with the wind in a dark
night—the night of the fifth of November if you are in England, or of
the fourth of July if you are in America. You can see fireworks which
are being sent off from the ground, from trains, and from aeroplanes
traveling in all directions, but you cannot see the ground or the
trains or the aeroplanes be cause of the darkness. What sort of picture
of the world will you form? You will think that nothing is permanent:
there are only brief flashes of light, which, during their short
existence, travel through the void in the most various and bizarre
curves. You cannot touch these flashes of light, you can only see them.
Obviously your geometry and your physics and your metaphysics will be
quite different from those of ordinary mortals. If an ordinary mortal
is with you in the balloon, you will find his speech unintelligible.
But if Einstein is with you, you will understand him more easily than
the ordinary mortal would, because you will be free from a host of
preconceptions which prevent most people from understanding him.

The theory of relativity depends, to a considerable extent, upon
getting rid of notions which are useful in ordinary life but not to
our drugged balloonist. Circumstances on the surface of the earth,
for various more or less accidental reasons, suggest conceptions
which turn out to be inaccurate, although they have come to seem like
necessities of thought. The most important of these circumstances is
that most objects on the earth’s surface are fairly persistent and
nearly stationary from a terrestrial point of view. If this were not
the case, the idea of going a journey would not seem so definite as it
does. If you want to travel from King’s Cross to Edinburgh, you know
that you will find King’s Cross where it always has been, that the
railway line will take the course that it did when you last made the
journey, and that Waverley Station in Edinburgh will not have walked up
to the Castle. You therefore say and think that you have traveled to
Edinburgh, not that Edinburgh has traveled to you, though the latter
statement would be just as accurate. The success of this common sense
point of view depends upon a number of things which are really of the
nature of luck. Suppose all the houses in London were perpetually
moving about, like a swarm of bees; suppose railways moved and changed
their shapes like avalanches; and finally suppose that material objects
were perpetually being formed and dissolved like clouds. There is
nothing impossible in these suppositions: something like them must have
been verified when the earth was hotter than it is now. But obviously
what we call a journey to Edinburgh would have no meaning in such a
world. You would begin, no doubt, by asking the taxi-driver: “Where
is King’s Cross this morning?“ At the station you would have to ask a
similar question about Edinburgh, but the booking-office clerk would
reply: “What part of Edinburgh do you mean, Sir? Prince’s Street has
gone to Glasgow, the Castle has moved up into the Highlands, and
Waverley Station is under water in the middle of the Firth of Forth.”
And on the journey the stations would not be staying quiet, but some
would be travelling north, some south, some east or west, perhaps much
faster than the train. Under these conditions you could not say where
you were at any moment. Indeed the whole notion that one is always in
some definite “place” is due to the fortunate immovability of most of
the large objects on the earth’s surface. The idea of “place” is only
a rough practical approximation: there is nothing logically necessary
about it, and it cannot be made precise.

If we were not much larger than an electron, we should not have this
impression of stability, which is only due to the grossness of our
senses. King’s Cross, which to us looks solid, would be too vast to
be conceived except by a few eccentric mathematicians. The bits of it
that we could see would consist of little tiny points of matter, never
coming into contact with each other, but perpetually whizzing round
each other in an inconceivably rapid ballet-dance. The world of our
experience would be quite as mad as the one in which the different
parts of Edinburgh go for walks in different directions. If—to take
the opposite extreme—you were as large as the sun and lived as long,
with a corresponding slowness of perception, you would again find
a higgledy-piggledy universe without permanence—stars and planets
would come and go like morning mists, and nothing would remain in a
fixed position relatively to anything else. The notion of comparative
stability which forms part of our ordinary outlook is thus due to the
fact that we are about the size we are, and live on a planet of which
the surface is no longer very hot. If this were not the case, we should
not find pre-relativity physics intellectually satisfying. Indeed, we
should never have invented such theories. We should have had to arrive
at relativity physics at one bound, or remain ignorant of scientific
laws. It is fortunate for us that we were not faced with this
alternative, since it is almost inconceivable that one man could have
done the work of Euclid, Galileo, Newton, and Einstein. Yet without
such an incredible genius physics could hardly have been discovered
in a world where the universal flux was obvious to non-scientific
observation.

In astronomy, although the sun, moon, and stars continue to exist year
after year, yet in other respects the world we have to deal with is
very different from that of everyday life. As already observed, we
depend exclusively on sight: the heavenly bodies cannot be touched,
heard, smelt or tasted. Everything in the heavens is moving relatively
to everything else. The earth is going round the sun, the sun is
moving, very much faster than an express train, towards a point in the
constellation “Hercules,” the “fixed” stars are scurrying hither and
thither like a lot of frightened hens. There are no well-marked places
in the sky, like King’s Cross and Edinburgh. When you travel from place
to place on the earth, you say the train moves and not the stations,
because the stations preserve their topographical relations to each
other and the surrounding country. But in astronomy it is arbitrary
which you call the train and which the station: the question is to be
decided purely by convenience and as a matter of convention.

In this respect, it is interesting to contrast Einstein and Copernicus.
Before Copernicus, people thought that the earth stood still and the
heavens revolved about it once a day. Copernicus taught that “really”
the earth rotates once a day, and the daily revolution of sun and stars
is only “apparent.” Galileo and Newton endorsed this view, and many
things were thought to prove it—for example, the flattening of the
earth at the poles, and the fact that bodies are heavier there than at
the equator. But in the modern theory the question between Copernicus
and his predecessors is merely one of convenience; all motion is
relative, and there is no difference between the two statements: “the
earth rotates once a day” and “the heavens revolve about the earth
once a day.” The two mean exactly the same thing, just as it means the
same thing if I say that a certain length is six feet or two yards.
Astronomy is easier if we take the sun as fixed than if we take the
earth, just as accounts are easier in a decimal coinage. But to say
more for Copernicus is to assume absolute motion, which is a fiction.
All motion is relative, and it is a mere convention to take one body as
at rest. All such conventions are equally legitimate, though not all
are equally convenient.

There is another matter of great importance, in which astronomy
differs from terrestrial physics because of its exclusive dependence
upon sight. Both popular thought and old-fashioned physics used the
notion of “force,” which seemed intelligible because it was associated
with familiar sensations. When we are walking, we have sensations
connected with our muscles which we do not have when we are sitting
still. In the days before mechanical traction, although people could
travel by sitting in their carriages, they could see the horses
exerting themselves and evidently putting out “force” in the same
way as human beings do. Everybody knew from experience what it is to
push or pull, or to be pushed or pulled. These very familiar facts
made “force” seem a natural basis for dynamics. But Newton’s law of
gravitation introduced a difficulty. The force between two billiard
balls appeared intelligible, because we know what it feels like to bump
into another person; but the force between the earth and the sun, which
are ninety-three million miles apart, was mysterious. Newton himself
regarded this “action at a distance” as impossible, and believed that
there was some hitherto undiscovered mechanism by which the sun’s
influence was transmitted to the planets. However, no such mechanism
was discovered, and gravitation remained a puzzle. The fact is that the
whole conception of “force” is a mistake. The sun does not exert any
force on the planets; in Einstein’s law of gravitation, the planet only
pays attention to what it finds in its own neighborhood. The way in
which this works will be explained in a later chapter; for the present
we are only concerned with the necessity of abandoning the notion of
“force,” which was due to misleading conceptions derived from the sense
of touch.

As physics has advanced, it has appeared more and more that sight is
less misleading than touch as a source of fundamental notions about
matter. The apparent simplicity in the collision of billiard balls is
quite illusory. As a matter of fact, the two billiard balls never touch
at all; what really happens is inconceivably complicated, but is more
analogous to what happens when a comet penetrates the solar system and
goes away again than to what common sense supposes to happen.

Most of what we have said hitherto was already recognized by physicists
before Einstein invented the theory of relativity. “Force” was known
to be merely a mathematical fiction, and it was generally held that
motion is a merely relative phenomenon—that is to say, when two
bodies are changing their relative position, we cannot say that one is
moving while the other is at rest, since the occurrence is merely a
change in their relation to each other. But a great labor was required
in order to bring the actual procedure of physics into harmony with
these new convictions. Newton believed in force and in absolute space
and time; he embodied these beliefs in his technical methods, and his
methods remained those of later physicists. Einstein invented a new
technique, free from Newton’s assumptions. But in order to do so he
had to change fundamentally the old ideas of space and time, which had
been unchallenged from time immemorial. This is what makes both the
difficulty and the interest of his theory. But before explaining it
there are some preliminaries which are indispensable. These will occupy
the next two chapters.
